     <center>PYTHON QUESTIONS</center>
    <h1><u>What is a Programming language ?</u></h1>
    <p>
     A <b>programming language</b> is a formal system of instructions used to communicate with a computer.<br> 
   Enables developers to write programs for various tasks such as web development, data analysis, and automation.<br> 	
      <strong>Examples:</strong><mark>C, Java, Python, JavaScript</mark>
   </p>

   
    <h1><u>Why Python?</u></h1>
    <p>
       1.<b>Ease of Use:</b> Simple syntax, ideal for beginners. <br>
       2.<b>Versatility:</b>Supports multiple programming paradigms (object-oriented, procedural, functional). <br>
       3.<b>Extensive Libraries:</b> Rich ecosystem for tasks like data analysis, machine learning, and web development.<br> 
       4.<b>Community Support:</b> Large and active community for troubleshooting and learning. <br>
       5.<b>Interpreted Language:</b> Python is executed line by line, which makes debugging easier. <br>
       6.<b>Cross-Platform:</b> Python programs can run on various platforms without modification (Windows, macOS, Linux). <br>
       7.<b>Scalability:</b> While often seen as a scripting language, Python scales well for larger applications when combined with appropriate frameworks or tools (e.g., Django)

     <h1><u>What is Python?</u></h1>
   <p>1.Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by <strong>Guido van Rossum</strong> in the late 1980s and first released in <b>1991</b>. Python emphasizes <b>code readability</b> and supports multiple programming paradigms, including <b>object-oriented, procedural</b>, and <b>functional programming.</b> <br>
    a. Monty Python’s Flying Circus<br>  
     2.	Older than Java (1995).  
</p>
  
<h1><u>Where Python is Used?</u></h1>
<P>
    1.<b>Web Development:</b> Frameworks: Django, Flask. <br>
    2.<b>Data Science and Machine Learning:</b> Predictive modeling and data analysis using NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, scikit-learn.<br> 
    3.<b>Automation (Scripting):</b> Automating repetitive tasks. <br>
    4.<b>Game Development:</b> Framework: PyGame. <br>
    5.<b>Scientific Computing:</b> Libraries: SciPy, Matplotlib. <br>
    6.<b>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning:</b>Libraries: Keras, PyTorch.<br> 
    7.<b>Web Scraping: Libraries:</b> BeautifulSoup, Scrapy. <br>
    8.<b>Cybersecurity:</b> Used for creating tools to test system vulnerabilities.<br> 

</P>
<h1><u> what is the disadvantages of Python?</u></h1>
  <p>
    1.Slower Execution Speed  <br>
       ○Interpreted language, making it slower than compiled languages like C++ or Java. <br> 
       ○ Not ideal for performance-critical applications (e.g., real-time systems, gaming engines). 
 </p>
  <p>
    2.	Memory Consumption <br>
       ○Python’s dynamic typing and garbage collection can lead to higher memory usage.<br> 
       ○ Not suitable for applications where memory optimization is crucial. 
 </p>
 <p>
    3.	Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) <br>
      ○	The GIL restricts the execution of multiple threads at the same time. <br>
      ○ This makes Python less efficient for multithreaded applications, especially on multi-core processors. 4. Runtime Errors <br>
      ○ Python’s dynamic nature allows runtime errors to occur if code is not thoroughly tested.<br> 
      ○ This can lead to bugs in production if not handled properly. 
</p>
<p>
   4. Limited Support for Low-Level Programming <br>
   ○ Languages like C or Rust are better suited for such tasks. 
</p>

<h1><u>What is the Different modes of working?</u></h1>
<p>
  1.<b>Interactive Mode:</b> Python code is executed directly in the Python shell or terminal. 
    a.In cmd: type py or python to enter into the python shell. 
      i. exit() to come out of the python shell. 
    b.Search idle in the window's search to directly enter the python shell. 
  2.	<b>Script Mode:</b> 
     a.Write Python programs in a .py file and execute them as a whole. 
     b.	Run using the command: python filename.py. 
  3.<b>Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):</b> 
     a.	Use tools like PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook, or VS Code for an enhanced coding experience. 
     b.	Offers features like debugging, syntax highlighting, and autocompletion.

<h1><u> How do you floor a number in Python?</u></h1>
<p>
  To floor a number in Python, you can use the math.floor() function, which returns the largest integer less than or equal to the given number.<br>

<b>floor()</b>method in Python returns the floor of x i.e., the largest integer not greater than x. <br>
Also, The method <b>ceil(x)</b> in Pythonreturns a ceiling value of x i.e., the smallest integer greater than or equal to x.

</p>
<h1><u>Is Indentation Required in Python?</u></h1>
<p>
Yes, <b>indentation</b> is required in Python. A Python interpreter can be informed that a group of statements belongs to a specific block of <br>code by using Python indentation. Indentations make the code easy to read for developers in all programming languages but in Python, it is<br> very important to indent the code in a specific order.
</p>
<h1><u> Can we Pass a function as an argument in Python?</u></h1>
<p>
Yes, Several arguments can be passed to a function, including objects, variables (of the same or distinct data types) and functions.<br> <b>Functions can be passed</b> as parameters to other functions because they are objects. Higher-order functions are functions that can take other<br> functions as arguments.

</p>
<h1><u>What is a lambda function?</u></h1>
<p>
A lambda function is an anonymous function. This function can have any number of parameters but, can have just one statement.<br>

In the example, we defined a lambda function(upper) to convert a string to its upper case using <b>upper()</b>.<br>
