        Hello! I'm Ravada Rajendra, a passionate and motivated Computer Science graduate specializing in Data Science. I enjoy building smart solutions using technology, and I have hands-on experience in web development, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

        I‚Äôve developed projects like a Todo Web App, an NLP-based Q&A model using Llama2, and object detection using CNN, showcasing my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and more. I‚Äôve also completed internships in Machine Learning and AI, and I‚Äôm certified in Web Development, NLP, and AI by reputed organizations.
        Ever since I wrote my first line of code, I‚Äôve been fascinated by how software can solve real-world problems and improve lives. I‚Äôm currently focusing on building dynamic, responsive web applications and exploring the power of Artificial Intelligence in automation and data analysis.

          Here‚Äôs a little more about me:

        I love building things from scratch ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs a website, an app, or an AI model.

        I'm a self-learner who believes in consistency and growth.

        Currently honing my skills in full-stack web development and machine learning.
    </p>
